This module provides the core functionality for defining functions that can be
executed as Temporal workflows.

In day-to-day conversations, the term Workflow frequently denotes either a Workflow Type, a Workflow Definition, or a Workflow Execution.

= What is a Workflow Definition?

A Workflow Definition is the code that defines the constraints of a Workflow Execution.

A Workflow Definition is often also referred to as a Workflow Function. In Temporal's documentation, a Workflow Definition refers to the source for the instance of a Workflow Execution, while a Workflow Function refers to the source for the instance of a Workflow Function Execution.

A Workflow Execution effectively executes once to completion, while a Workflow Function Execution occurs many times during the life of a Workflow Execution.

= Deterministic constraints

A critical aspect of developing Workflow Definitions is ensuring they exhibit certain deterministic traits â€“ that is, making sure that the same Commands are emitted in the same sequence, whenever a corresponding Workflow Function Execution (instance of the Function Definition) is re-executed.

The execution semantics of a Workflow Execution include the re-execution of a Workflow Function, which is called a Replay. The use of Workflow APIs in the function is what generates Commands. Commands tell the Cluster which Events to create and add to the Workflow Execution's Event History. When a Workflow Function executes, the Commands that are emitted are compared with the existing Event History. If a corresponding Event already exists within the Event History that maps to the generation of that Command in the same sequence, and some specific metadata of that Command matches with some specific metadata of the Event, then the Function Execution progresses.

For example, using an SDK's "Execute Activity" API generates the ScheduleActivityTask Command. When this API is called upon re-execution, that Command is compared with the Event that is in the same location within the sequence. The Event in the sequence must be an ActivityTaskScheduled Event, where the Activity name is the same as what is in the Command.

If a generated Command doesn't match what it needs to in the existing Event History, then the Workflow Execution returns a non-deterministic error.

The following are the two reasons why a Command might be generated out of sequence or the wrong Command might be generated altogether:

- Code changes are made to a Workflow Definition that is in use by a running Workflow Execution.
- There is intrinsic non-deterministic logic (such as inline random branching).

= Code changes can cause non-deterministic behavior

The Workflow Definition can change in very limited ways once there is a Workflow Execution depending on it. To alleviate non-deterministic issues that arise from code changes, we recommend using Workflow Versioning.

For example, let's say we have a Workflow Definition that defines the following sequence:

1. Start and wait on a Timer/sleep.
2. Spawn and wait on an Activity Execution.
3. Complete.

We start a Worker and spawn a Workflow Execution that uses that Workflow Definition. The Worker would emit the StartTimer Command and the Workflow Execution would become suspended.

Before the Timer is up, we change the Workflow Definition to the following sequence:

1. Spawn and wait on an Activity Execution.
2. Start and wait on a Timer/sleep.
3. Complete.

When the Timer fires, the next Workflow Task will cause the Workflow Function to re-execute. The first Command the Worker sees would be ScheduleActivityTask Command, which wouldn't match up to the expected TimerStarted Event.

The Workflow Execution would fail and return a non-deterministic error.

The following are examples of minor changes that would not result in non-determinism errors when re-executing a History which already contain the Events:

- Changing the duration of a Timer
- Changing the arguments to:

    * The Activity Options in a call to spawn an Activity Execution (local or nonlocal).
    * The Child Workflow Options in a call to spawn a Child Workflow Execution.
    * Call to Signal an External Workflow Execution.

- Adding a Signal Handler for a Signal Type that has not been sent to this Workflow Execution.

= Workflow Versioning

Note: not yet implemented

The Workflow Versioning feature enables the creation of logical branching inside a Workflow Definition based on a developer specified version identifier. This feature is useful for Workflow Definition logic needs to be updated, but there are running Workflow Executions that currently depends on it. It is important to note that a practical way to handle different versions of Workflow Definitions, without using the versioning API, is to run the different versions on separate Task Queues.

= Handling unreliable Worker Processes

You do not handle Worker Process failure or restarts in a Workflow Definition.

Workflow Function Executions are completely oblivious to the Worker Process in terms of failures or downtime. The Temporal Platform ensures that the state of a Workflow Execution is recovered and progress resumes if there is an outage of either Worker Processes or the Temporal Cluster itself. The only reason a Workflow Execution might fail is due to the code throwing an error or exception, not because of underlying infrastructure outages.

{- $activityBasics

An Activity is an IO-based function that executes a single, well-defined action (either short or long running),
such as calling another service, transcoding a media file, or sending an email message.
Activity code can be non-deterministic.

We recommend that it be idempotent.

Workflow code orchestrates the execution of Activities, persisting the results.
If an Activity Function Execution fails, any future execution starts from initial state (except Heartbeats).

Activity Functions are executed by Worker Processes. When the Activity Function returns,
the Worker sends the results back to the Temporal Cluster as part of the ActivityTaskCompleted Event.
The Event is added to the Workflow Execution's Event History.

Versioning (known as "patching" in the Haskell library) lets you update Workflow Definitions
without causing non-deterministic behavior in current long-running Workflows.

- If your new logic can result in a different execution path

If the workflow is replaying an existing history, then this function returns true if that history
was produced by a worker which also had a patched call with the same patchId.

If the history was produced by a worker without such a call, then it will return false.

If the workflow is not currently replaying, then this call always returns true.

Your workflow code should run the "new" code if this returns true, if it returns false,
you should run the "old" code. By doing this, you can maintain determinism.

Workflows with this call may be deployed alongside workflows with a patched call, but they must not be deployed while any workers
still exist running old code without a patched call, or any runs with histories produced by such workers exist.
If either kind of worker encounters a history produced by the other, their behavior is undefined.

Once all live workflow runs have been produced by workers with this call, you can deploy workers which are free of either kind of
patch call for this ID. Workers with and without this call may coexist, as long as they are both running the "new" code.

{- $randomness

Workflow executions are deterministic, so you can't use the usual IO-based random number generation.

Instead, each workflow execution is given a seed from the Temporal platform to seed a PRNG. This
allows you to generate random values in a deterministic way.

The 'Workflow' monad provides a 'RandomGen' instance, so you can use the usual 'random' and 'randomR'
functions from the 'System.Random' and 'System.Random.Stateful' modules.

{- $queries

A Query is a synchronous operation that is used to get the state of a Workflow Execution.
The state of a running Workflow Execution is constantly changing.
You can use Queries to expose the internal Workflow Execution state to the external world.
Queries are available for running or completed Workflows Executions only if the Worker is
up and listening on the Task Queue.

Queries are strongly consistent and are guaranteed to return the most recent state.
This means that the data reflects the state of all confirmed Events that came in before
the Query was sent. An Event is considered confirmed if the call creating the Event returned
success. Events that are created while the Query is outstanding may or may not be reflected
in the Workflow state the Query result is based on.

A Query can carry arguments to specify the data it is requesting. And each Workflow can expose data to multiple types of Queries.

A Query cannot mutate the state of the Workflow Executionâ€” that is, Queries are read-only and cannot contain any blocking code.
This means, for example, that Query handling logic cannot schedule Activity Executions.

{- | Continue-As-New is a mechanism by which the latest relevant state is passed to a new Workflow Execution, with a fresh Event History.

As a precautionary measure, the Temporal Platform limits the total Event History to 51,200 Events or 50 MB, and will warn you after
10,240 Events or 10 MB. To prevent a Workflow Execution Event History from exceeding this limit and failing,
use Continue-As-New to start a new Workflow Execution with a fresh Event History.

All values passed to a Workflow Execution through parameters or returned through a result value are recorded into the Event History.
A Temporal Cluster stores the full Event History of a Workflow Execution for the duration of a Namespace's retention period.
A Workflow Execution that periodically executes many Activities has the potential of hitting the size limit.

A very large Event History can adversely affect the performance of a Workflow Execution. For example, in the case of a Workflow Worker failure,
the full Event History must be pulled from the Temporal Cluster and given to another Worker via a Workflow Task.
If the Event history is very large, it may take some time to load it.

The Continue-As-New feature enables developers to complete the current Workflow Execution and start a new one atomically.

The new Workflow Execution has the same Workflow Id, but a different Run Id, and has its own Event History.

{- | While workflows are deterministic, there are categories of operational concerns (metrics, logging, tracing, etc.) that require
access to IO operations like the network or filesystem. The 'IO' monad is not generally available in the 'Workflow' monad, but you
can use 'sink' to run an 'IO' action in a workflow. In order to maintain determinism, the operation will be executed asynchronously
and does not return a value. Be sure that the sink operation terminates, or else you will leak memory and/or threads.

Do not use 'sink' for any Workflow logic, or else you will violate determinism.
