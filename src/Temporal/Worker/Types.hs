{- |
A Signal is an asynchronous request to a Workflow Execution.

A Signal delivers data to a running Workflow Execution. It cannot return data to the caller; 
to do so, use a Query instead. The Workflow code that handles a Signal can mutate Workflow state. 
A Signal can be sent from a Temporal Client or a Workflow. 
When a Signal is sent, it is received by the Cluster and recorded as an Event to the Workflow Execution Event History. 
A successful response from the Cluster means that the Signal has been persisted and will be delivered at least once to 
the Workflow Execution.

A Signal must include a destination (Namespace and Workflow Id) and name. It can include a list of arguments.

Signal handlers are Workflow functions that listen for Signals by the Signal name. 
Signals are delivered in the order they are received by the Cluster. 
If multiple deliveries of a Signal would be a problem for your Workflow, add idempotency logic to your Signal handler 
that checks for duplicates.

{- |
Queries are sent from a Temporal Client to a Workflow Execution. The API call is synchronous. The Query is identified at both ends by a Query name. The Workflow must have a Query handler that is developed to handle that Query and provide data that represents the state of the Workflow Execution.

Queries are strongly consistent and are guaranteed to return the most recent state. 
This means that the data reflects the state of all confirmed Events that came in before the Query was sent. 
An Event is considered confirmed if the call creating the Event returned success. 
Events that are created while the Query is outstanding may or may not be reflected in the Workflow state the Query result is based on.

A Query can carry arguments to specify the data it is requesting. And each Workflow can expose data to multiple types of Queries.

A Query must never mutate the state of the Workflow Executionâ€”
that is, Queries are read-only and cannot contain any blocking code. 
This means, for example, that Query handling logic cannot schedule Activity Executions.

Sending Queries to completed Workflow Executions is supported, though Query reject conditions can be configured per Query
