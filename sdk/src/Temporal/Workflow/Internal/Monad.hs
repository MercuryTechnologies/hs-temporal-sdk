{- | The Workflow monad is a constrained execution environment that helps
developers write code that can be executed deterministically and reliably.

If a Workflow execution is interrupted, for example due to a server failure,
or otherwise fails to complete, the Temporal service will automatically
replay the Workflow execution up to the point of interruption with the same
inputs at each step in the function.

The 'st' state may be used to store information that is needed to respond to
any queries or signals that are received by the Workflow execution.

Workflow code must be deterministic. This means:

- no threading
- no randomness
- no external calls to processes
- no network I/O
- no global state mutation
- no system date or time

This might seem like a lot of restrictions, but Temporal provides a number of
functions that allow you to use similar functionality in a deterministic way.

A critical aspect of developing Workflow Definitions is ensuring they exhibit certain deterministic traits –
that is, making sure that the same Commands are emitted in the same sequence,
whenever a corresponding Workflow Function Execution (instance of the Function Definition) is re-executed.

-- pieces.  It works like this:
--
--   ff <*> aa
--
-- becomes
--
--   (ff >>= putIVar i) <*> (a <- aa; f <- getIVar i; return (f a)
--
-- where the IVar i is a new synchronisation point.  If the right side
-- gets to the `getIVar` first, it will block until the left side has
-- called 'putIVar'.
--
-- We can also do it the other way around:
--
--   (do ff <- f; getIVar i; return (ff a)) <*> (a >>= putIVar i)
