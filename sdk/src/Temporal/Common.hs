{- | A Run Id is a globally unique, platform-level identifier for a Workflow Execution.

The current Run Id is mutable and can change during a Workflow Retry. You shouldn't rely on storing the current Run Id, or using it for any logical choices, because a Workflow Retry changes the Run Id and can lead to non-determinism issues.

Temporal guarantees that only one Workflow Execution with a given Workflow Id can be in an Open state at any given time. But when a Workflow Execution reaches a Closed state, it is possible to have another Workflow Execution in an Open state with the same Workflow Id. For example, a Temporal Cron Job is a chain of Workflow Executions that all have the same Workflow Id. Each Workflow Execution within the chain is considered a Run.

A Run Id uniquely identifies a Workflow Execution even if it shares a Workflow Id with other Workflow Executions.

{- | A Task Queue is a queue that a Worker Process polls for Tasks.

Task Queues do not have any ordering guarantees.
It is possible to have a Task that stays in a Task Queue for a period of time, if there is a backlog that wasn't drained for that time.

Task Queues are very lightweight components.
Task Queues do not require explicit registration but instead are created on demand when a Workflow Execution or Activity spawns or
when a Worker Process subscribes to it. When a Task Queue is created, both a Workflow Task Queue and an Activity Task Queue are
created under the same name. There is no limit to the number of Task Queues a Temporal Application can use or a Temporal Cluster
can maintain.

  , backoffCoefficient :: Double
  -- ^ The value dictates how much the retry interval increases.
  --
  -- The default value is 2.0.
  --
  -- A backoff coefficient of 1.0 means that the retry interval always equals the Initial Interval.
  --
  -- Use case: Use this attribute to increase the interval between retries. By having a backoff coefficient greater than 1.0, the first few retries happen relatively
  -- quickly to overcome intermittent failures, but subsequent retries happen farther and farther apart to account for longer outages. Use the Maximum Interval attribute
  -- to prevent the coefficient from increasing the retry interval too much.
  , maximumInterval :: Maybe Duration
  -- ^ Specifies the maximum interval between retries.
  --
  -- The default value is 100x of the Initial Interval.
  --
  -- Use case: This attribute is useful for Backoff Coefficients that are greater than 1.0 because it prevents the retry interval from growing infinitely.
  , maximumAttempts :: Int32
  -- ^ Specifies the maximum number of execution attempts that can be made in the presence of failures.
  --
  -- The default is unlimited.
  --
  -- If this limit is exceeded, the execution fails without retrying again. When this happens an error is returned.
  --
  -- * Setting the value to 0 also means unlimited.
  -- * Setting the value to 1 means a single execution attempt and no retries.
  -- * Setting the value to a negative integer results in an error when the execution is invoked.
  --
  -- Use case: Use this attribute to ensure that retries do not continue indefinitely. However, in the majority of cases, we recommend relying on the Workflow Execution Timeout,
  -- in the case of Workflows, or Schedule-To-Close Timeout, in the case of Activities, to limit the total duration of retries instead of using this attribute.

  -- Errors are matched against the @type@ field of the Application Failure.
