{- | Test-only bindings for exercising the Tokio FFI bridge.

These wrap tiny bridge fixtures (prefixed @hs_temporal_test_@ on the Rust
side) that exist purely so test suites can observe cross-language resource
management, e.g. that a Rust result produced after the Haskell waiter was
interrupted is still reclaimed by the cleanup thread. They are compiled into
the production bridge library because the test suites link the same artifact,
but nothing outside of tests should call them.
